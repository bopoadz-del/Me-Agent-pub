# Ship-gate evidence — Me-Agent

Branch: `ship/gate-parity`  
Spec SSOT: `SELF_AGENT_SPEC_V1.md` (open PR #1 — not yet on main; ship-gate does not claim full §11.4 completion)  
Date: 2026-08-05

## Scope

Phase A host gates + CI. Phase B (`make verify-airgap`, live Ollama E2E §11.4 step 7) is **REGISTERED ONLY** in `KNOWN_INCOMPLETE.md` — never executed in this ship-gate.

## FINDINGS C — `scripts/enroll_bootstrap_agent.py`

**Decision: keep + fix prints → structured logger.**

- Still operational: `scripts/hive_docker_entrypoint.sh` runs `python scripts/enroll_bootstrap_agent.py` before uvicorn.
- Not imported by `hive/`, `agent/`, or `common/` runtime modules (grep: only entrypoint / docs).
- Replaced `print` with `common.logging.get_logger` / `log_event`, plus stderr `StreamHandler` for Docker boot visibility.
- `make detect` stays green (scripts dir skipped per A2 `SKIP_DIRS`; enroll script itself has no banned `print`).

## FINDINGS B — completeness gate (b1)

`scripts/stub_detector.py` reads `KNOWN_INCOMPLETE.md`:

- Required registry markers: `make verify-airgap`, `11.4`, `Windows spawn`
- Optional path allow-list lines: `- path: relative/path.py`
- Meta-tests in `tests/unit/test_stub_detector.py`: planted hollow → exit 1; allowlisted hollow → exit 0; missing registry → exit 1

Local red→green (completeness):

```
=== RED (planted hollow) ===
STUB DETECTOR FAILED:
  agent\_shipgate_hollow_probe.py:1 incomplete [pass]
red_exit=1
=== GREEN (reverted) ===
STUB DETECTOR PASSED.
green_exit=0
```

## FINDINGS G — `KNOWN_INCOMPLETE.md` summary

| Item | Status | Command / action |
|------|--------|------------------|
| Phase B verify-airgap | deferred pending Linux+Docker | `make verify-airgap` |
| Phase B live E2E §11.4 step 7 | deferred pending Linux+Docker+Ollama | curl mission flow from spec |
| Windows spawn caveat | WEAK on Windows | re-run on Linux in Phase B |
| Critical-path triviality allowlist | enforced (ruling 2: route handlers exempt by structure; helpers folded) | — |

## FINDINGS E — `tests/e2e/`

Mock / `TEST_MODE` cold-boot stranger flows:

- E1 bootstrapper ready
- E2 mission happy path
- E3 refusal + injection (fixtures via `pytest_plugins`)
- E4 auth (challenge JWT + bearer gate + WS 4401)

## FINDINGS A — `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

- Triggers: push + PR
- Python 3.11, `requirements.txt`, `pip install -e .`, `TEST_MODE=true`
- Jobs: Phase A (`detect`, `test-unit`, `test-integration`, `test-e2e`, `mutation-gate`, `compile-domain` + generated tests)
- Separate job **Phase B registered skip** with visible `::notice::` reasons (not silent absence)

## Local Phase A terminal evidence (Windows host, 2026-08-05)

```
=== DETECT ===
STUB DETECTOR PASSED.
SECRET SCAN PASSED.

=== UNIT ===
27 passed

=== INTEGRATION ===
10 passed, 1 deselected (airgap)

=== E2E ===
5 passed

=== MUTATION ===
MUTATION GATE PASSED.

=== COMPILE + generated ===
1 passed (tests/generated/)
```

PR: https://github.com/<owner>/Me-Agent/pull/8 — **MERGED** 2026-08-05T03:31:19Z

Green job list (post-merge main): `Phase A gates` (detect, test-unit, test-integration, test-e2e, mutation-gate, compile-domain + generated), `Phase B registered skip` (visible SKIP notices for verify-airgap + §11.4 step 7).

## Runtime touch confirmation

**Zero** changes under `hive/`, `agent/`, or `common/` runtime logic. Only FINDINGS C (`scripts/enroll_bootstrap_agent.py`) plus gate/CI/docs/e2e tooling.

## Files changed (grouped)

| Group | Paths |
|-------|--------|
| ci | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |
| gate | `scripts/stub_detector.py`, `tests/unit/test_stub_detector.py`, `Makefile`, `KNOWN_INCOMPLETE.md` |
| e2e | `tests/e2e/*` |

| docs | `docs/SHIP_GATE_MEAGENT.md` (this file) |

## BLOCKED / notes

1. HTTPS `gh` OAuth lacked `workflow` scope for pushing `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; push succeeded via **SSH**. No remaining push blocker.
2. Spec file `SELF_AGENT_SPEC_V1.md` still lives on open PR #1 — not on main at ship time; no conflict with Phase B registration.
3. Triviality `<2` rule: enforced since owner ruling 2 (route handlers exempt by structure).
4. Phase B never executed (REGISTERED ONLY).
